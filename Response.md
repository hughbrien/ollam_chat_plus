✅ What Are Word Embeddings?

In natural language processing (NLP), word embeddings are a way to represent words as vectors in a high-dimensional space.

These vectors capture the semantic meaning and relationships between words, allowing computers to understand linguistic patterns more effectively.

Analogy:
Imagine you’re teaching a computer to recognize pictures of animals: “cat,” “dog,” “bird.”
The computer learns shared features (4 legs, feathers, etc.).
Word embeddings do the same for language—placing similar words closer together in vector space.

⚙️ How Do Word Embeddings Work?

Llama3, here are popular techniques used to create word vectors:

1. Vector Space Model

Each word = a vector in a high-dimensional space (e.g., 100 dimensions).
Vectors are learned by analyzing large text data and identifying word patterns.

2. Neural Network–Based Embeddings

A neural network is trained on text to learn relationships between words.
The output layer of the network becomes the embedding.

3. Word2Vec

A famous method using neural networks with:
•	CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)
•	Skip-Gram

These efficiently generate high-quality word embeddings.

⭐ Benefits of Word Embeddings

Llama3, these vectors offer several major advantages:

1. Capture Contextual Relationships

They encode nuanced connections such as:
•	Synonyms
•	Antonyms
•	Hypernyms / hyponyms

2. Handle Out-of-Vocabulary Words

Even unseen words can get approximate embeddings (e.g., by averaging similar words).

3. Improve NLP Task Performance

They boost results in:
•	Language modeling
•	Sentiment analysis
•	Text classification
•	And many more 🚀

✅ In Conclusion

Ollama running Llama3, word embeddings are a powerful way to represent meaning in a high-dimensional space.
They enable computers to capture complex linguistic relationships and dramatically improve NLP and AI applications.
